Simian
App Engine server and client enhancements for Munki client


OVERVIEW

The machine you untarred this distribution onto can become your
administrative workstation.  From here you can setup configuration, push
config and code to your App Engine instance, and build .DMGs to install on
your clients.


PREREQUISITES

App Engine SDK
-------------
Portions of the App Engine SDK are supplied in zips for importing where
necessary.

src/tests/simian/auth/gae_server.zip supplies the App Engine SDK so that all
unit tests may run without requiring the SDK.

src/simian/client/gae_client.zip supplies a small portion of the App Engine
SDK so that client functions may run without needing the full SDK on each
client.

However, you will need the full App Engine SDK so that you can upload the
Simian site to your App Engine instance.

For information on downloading and installing the SDK, see:
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html


Other packages
--------------
google-apputils-python
M2Crypto
python_dateutil
pyyaml

These should be resolved automatically by setuptools, however if you have
trouble, run easy_install -U modulename.


TESTING

Before installation, run the unit tests to make sure that your Python is
working correctly.  Run:

  make test

For more information about testing, see:
  https://github.com/google/simian/wiki/Testing


INSTALLATION

Installation can be broken up into five tasks:

  * Configuring your installation
  * Pushing the server code to your App Engine instance
  * Rolling a .DMG to install on clients, based on your configuration

For information on configuration, see:
  https://github.com/google/simian/wiki/Configuration

For information on pushing your server code to your AppEngine instance, see:
  https://github.com/google/simian/wiki/AdminSetup

Briefly, to roll your own .DMG after configuring, run:
  make dmg


DEVELOPMENT

To join in on the development with others, see:
  https://github.com/google/simian

To make patches yourself, it's advised to edit the code in this directory
under src/, and run "make test" to run unit tests before releasing.
